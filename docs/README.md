# Data Lab Documentation

The Data Lab documentation is in development and divided into the following sections:
- [Readme](./README.md)
- [Data Lab Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Data Lab Deployment](./DATALAB-DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Infrastructure deployment and environment preparation](./INFRA-ENV-DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Infrastructure deployment and environment preparation - manual](./INFRA-ENV-DEPLOYMENT-MANUAL.md)
- [Data Lab Operating](./OPERATING.md)
- [Data Lab Limitations](./LIMITATIONS.md)
- [Data Lab Alerts & Notifications](./ALERTS-NOTIFICATIONS.md)
- [Data Lab Initialization](./DATALAB-INIT.md)
- [Data Lab ACL](./PERMISSIONS.md)
- [Data Lab Release Strategy](./RELEASE-STRATEGY.md)
- [Data Lab External Images](./EXTERNAL-IMAGES.md)

If you have the infrastructure deployed and the environment prepared as it is described in the [Prerequisites](./DATALAB-DEPLOYMENT.md#prerequisites), you can go directy to the [Datalab deployment](DATALAB-DEPLOYMENT.md). Otherwise you can redirect to the [Infrastructure deployment and environment preparation](./INFRA-ENV-DEPLOYMENT.md) first.
