# Deployment

To deploy the current version of the Data Lab the only requirements are a Kubernetes Cluster with an ingress controller (reverse proxy), and a domain name. If you have one you can start the deployment from [here](#network). However, if you do not have a Kubernetes Cluster, this document guides you to the deployment of one in AWS.

The document is divided in four parts:
1. [Kubernetes Cluster](#kubernetes-cluster)
2. [Network](#network)
3. [Data Lab Deployment](#data-lab-deployment)
4. [Additional Configurations](#additional-configurations)

## Kubernetes Cluster

## Network
Ingress Controller, CNAME, TLS

## Data Lab Deployment
Helm install complete package with all the initial configurations already set up.
